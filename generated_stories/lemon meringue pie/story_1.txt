The first time I made lemon meringue pie...and then had to eat it all the way through!



Then, while we were still in Boston, we visited T.H. White's house. He is the author of the much loved The Once and Future King. We learned that he lived his life so that when he died he would be remembered, not by people who knew him well, but by those who would come after. I was moved to tears.



But for me, the best part was seeing this:

When I finished reading the article, my face was red but my eyes were shining. This is a picture of the kind of person I think I am. And it is both very encouraging and inspiring because it reminds me to enjoy life, put my best foot forward and be kind to everyone I meet.
